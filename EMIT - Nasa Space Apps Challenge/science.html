            <p>Strong winds transport mineral dust from Earth's desert and dryland regions across long distances. Mineral dust may have a variety of effects on the Earth's ecology depending on its colour and composition. Dark particles absorb sunlight and heat our globe, whereas light particles may cool it. 
                The effect of mineral dust on climate depends on various factors, including the type and concentration of dust, atmospheric conditions, and geographical location.</p>
            <p>Understanding the role of mineral dust in the climate system is essential for climate scientists studying global climate patterns and their potential changes due to natural or anthropogenic factors.
                The NASA Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) mission will study the mineral composition of Earth's dust source areas for the first time, allowing scientists to better understand how they heat and cool our planet.</p>
            <p><b>The research aims of EMIT are primarily aimed at better understanding this heating and cooling impact, known as radiative forcing. The primary goal is to provide a new and improved evaluation of mineral dust's heating and cooling impacts in the Earth's atmosphere. The second goal is to forecast how future climatic scenarios would affect the volume and kind of mineral dust discharged into the Earth's atmosphere.</b></p>

            <div>
                <p>To accomplish these goals, EMIT will employ image spectroscopy, a cutting-edge technique developed by NASA and widely employed in the agency's space missions. EMIT will measure the spectrum of light reflected from Earth's surface at each position in a picture, spanning from visible to infrared. The observations will show different 
                    spectral signatures (or 'fingerprints') of minerals in dust-producing locations. The findings will subsequently be used by scientists to create new, more precise mineral composition maps of Earth's dust source areas.</p>

                <p class="caption">One of NASA's aerial missions was utilised to put EMIT's spectroscopic technique to mineral composition mapping to the test. The Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) instrument obtained the vast data collection seen in the picture above in the Salton Sea region of California.
                    AVIRIS effectively mapped the minerals hematite, goethite, calcite, and kaolinite based on their individual spectral fingerprints by collecting a spectrum for each point in the picture. These are critical minerals in the EMIT research.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The new maps from the expedition will be used by the EMIT research team to initialise complex Earth System Models. The improved models will assist scientists in better understanding the influence of mineral dust composition, as well as in reducing ambiguity in dust-related heating and cooling effects on Earth. The simulations will also be run for future climate scenarios to determine how dust sources may vary,
                 which will help researchers understand how dust's heating and cooling impacts may alter as well.</p>

            <p>EMIT uses an advanced two mirror telescope and high throughput F/1.8 Dyson imaging spectrometer. The telescope focuses light entering EMIT on the spectrometer slit where it passed through calcium fluoride crystal refractive element to the grating. The concave grating has a structured blaze written by electron beam lithography to optimize the diffraction efficiency over the full spectral range. 
                After being dispersed into the spectrum by the grating, light passes back through CaF2 block to the order sorting filter and detector array.</p>

            <p>This is the EMIT instrument configuration for operation on the ISS. The optical elements of the telescope and spectrometer are contained within the Optical Bench Assembly (OBA). The electronics are contained within the Electronics Baseplate (EB). The electronics receive, amplify, and digitize the weak analog signals from the detector array. These high rate data are compressed and stored on a digital recorder for replay to the ISS for transmission to the ground. 
                EMIT also includes a sophisticated thermal control system that is required to measure the signals in the short wavelength (infrared) region of the spectrum and for optoechanical stability. Heat generated within EMIT is radiated to space to maintain thermal balance.</p>
